# Arduino-Car-Project

This repo is for a Christmans holiday project where I put together a small vehicle. The vehicle was driven by a stepper motor, and would go in one direction. If an obstacle was sensed in front, the motor would change its direction and the vehicle would go in the opposite direction.

An Arduino UNO was used with a stepper motor (5V), motor controller and an ultrasonic distance sensor.
